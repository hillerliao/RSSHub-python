## 🛠 Advanced Features

### Dynamic Source Discovery (`/randomline`)
Extract random content blocks from various file formats.
- Supports: `CSV`, `TSV`, `TXT`, `PDF`, `EPUB`, `MOBI`, and Web URLs.
- Features: Automatic paragraph joining for PDFs and readability extraction for web pages.

### Proxy Readability (`/proxy/readability`)
A dedicated endpoint to extract clean text from any URL, stripping away ads and navigation.

### Universal Filtering
Filter any feed using URL parameters:
- `include_title` / `include_description`: Case-insensitive keyword matching (supports `|` for OR).
